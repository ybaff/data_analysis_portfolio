Project: Python Adoption by Country.

Objective: Analyse the percentage of developers in each country who report using python.

Data: Stack Overflow Developer Survey (public CSV).

Method: Grouped respondents by country and calculated the percentage who listed Python as a language they've worked with.

# Key Findings:

Typical Python adoption is 30-44% across most countries.

Extreme values are often driven by small sample sizes.

Adoption appears globally consistent rather than specific to regions.

# Limitations:

Survey bias towards stack overflow users

Smaller sample size in some countries

Self reported language usage and profeciency

Tools: Python, Pandas, Jupyter Notebook
